# Brand Consistency AI Skill

A brand config-driven skill that turns any LLM into a full-stack brand guardian. Feed it a structured JSON file once, and it enforces colors, typography, tone of voice, and platform specs across every deliverable — automatically.

## When to Use This Skill

- Generate copy, social posts, or presentations that must match brand guidelines
- Audit an existing material (poster, deck, email) for brand compliance
- Produce content for multiple channels with different tone requirements
- Verify platform-specific dimensions before producing any asset

## What This Skill Does

1. **Brand-Compliant Copy Generation**: Adapts tone for each channel — LinkedIn, WeChat, Instagram, email, X, and more
2. **100-Point Compliance Audit**: Scores materials across Logo, Color, Typography, Imagery, Layout, and Copy
3. **Platform Spec Enforcement**: Applies correct dimensions for 50+ deliverable types automatically
4. **Color Contrast Validation**: Checks all color combinations against WCAG AA standards

## How to Use

Attach your brand-config.json and say: I am attaching my brand-config.json. Act as my brand consistency assistant. For all outputs, follow the tone, colors, and typography defined in the config.

## Example

**User**: Write a LinkedIn post and a Xiaohongshu caption for our new product launch.

**Output**: Two distinct pieces of copy — LinkedIn uses formal expert tone; Xiaohongshu uses warm first-person voice — both aligned to brand personality traits from the config.

**Inspired by:** Brand operations workflows at scale.

## Tips

- The more complete your brand-config.json, the more precise the outputs
- Works with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and any LLM that accepts file attachments
- Use the 100-point audit on existing materials before producing new ones

## Common Use Cases

- Marketing teams producing multi-channel content at scale
- Brand managers auditing agency deliverables for compliance
- Startups establishing brand consistency without a dedicated design system
- Agencies managing multiple brand identities simultaneously
