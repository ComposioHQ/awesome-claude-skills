# Theme Factory

Load the `awesome-claude-skills:theme-factory` skill and follow its workflow to apply a theme.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the artifact to style or the theme name to apply.

Otherwise, ask the user what artifact they want to theme and which of the 10 pre-set themes to use.
